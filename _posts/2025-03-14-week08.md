title: Week 7 - Open Source AI Definition  
---

## Introduction  
This week, we had a class speaker, Nick Vidal, from the Open Source Initiative (OSI) present about the Open Source AI Definition. The talk provided insight into how the open source community is defining AI development and ensuring transparency, accessibility, and ethical considerations in this rapidly evolving space.

## Key Takeaways  
One of the most surprising things I learned was how complex the discussion around open source AI really is. Unlike traditional open source software, AI involves not just code but also datasets and models, which present unique challenges in terms of privacy. The Open Source AI Definition aims to provide clarity on what it means for AI to be open source, distinguishing between open-weight and fully open-source models.  

Another interesting point was the emphasis on reproducibility and access. Simply sharing model weights is not enough; for an AI system to be considered open source, there needs to be transparency in how it was trained, the datasets used, and the ability for others to modify and deploy it freely. This perspective made me rethink how open some of the so-called “open” AI models really are.  

## Changing Perspectives  
Before this talk, I assumed that AI could follow the same open-source principles as traditional software, but this presentation highlighted the nuances that make AI different. The level of control that organizations have over datasets and infrastructure means that many AI systems, even when partially open, still rely on proprietary elements. This raises important questions about accessibility and whether AI can ever be fully democratized.  

The talk also reinforced the importance of community involvement in shaping these definitions. If open-source AI is to thrive, developers, researchers, and policymakers need to work together to create standards that prevent AI from being locked behind corporate interests while still maintaining ethical safeguards.  

## Moving Forward  
After this presentation, I'd like to explore more about how AI openness is measured and what initiatives are working to increase transparency. It would also be interesting to see how different organizations are adopting the Open Source AI Definition and whether this will lead to real shifts in how AI models are developed and shared.  

Overall, I am very appreciative for the presentation which sparked a lot of interest in exploring the space more thoroughly.
