title: Week 14 - Oppia Presentation Prep and Reflections on Other Teams  
---

## Introduction  
This week in our Open Source Software Development class, we’ve been finishing up our contributions to **Oppia** and getting ready to share what we’ve worked on. It’s been a good chance to reflect on what we’ve learned and also check out how other teams tackled their projects.

## Update on Group Project – Oppia  
My team wrapped up our **presentation slides** this week and ran through a few practice sessions to get our timing right. We made some tweaks along the way—trimming parts down, rewording a few slides—but we’re happy with how it turned out. We present tomorrow, and I think we’ve got a solid flow.

Practicing also made us take a step back and really see how much we’ve done since the start—setting up the project, contributing to the codebase, and figuring out how to navigate the open source workflow. It’s been a learning curve, but a good one.

## Reflections on Other Presentations  
Watching **other teams present** this week has been one of the more interesting parts of class. Even though we were all contributing to open source projects, every group had a different approach.

One team leaned on a member who had a lot of **machine learning experience**, which helped them tackle some tough contributions. But what I appreciated was that the whole group still stayed involved and contributed alongside that, which showed solid teamwork.

Another team tried something different and **split into two smaller groups** to handle issues faster. Since open source projects move quickly and contributors from around the world can jump on issues, this was a smart way to cover more ground and avoid getting stuck waiting for tasks. It was cool to hear how that strategy played out for them.

Overall, seeing these different approaches made me realize there isn’t just one way to work on open source. Every team found what worked best for them, and it was helpful to hear those stories.
