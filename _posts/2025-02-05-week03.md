title: Week 3 - Browser Extension Open Source Project
---

## Idea
For this week's project, our team came up with the idea of developing a browser extension designed to quickly reference common and useful git commands. We wanted to create a tool that would save time for beginner developers and help eliminate confusion when it comes to executing essential git commands. This extension will serve as a handy reference for users, streamlining the workflow of git-related tasks.

## Progress
This week, we focused on understanding the problem we wanted to solve. Our first step was to write down the git commands we typically used and also research additional commands that might benefit other developers. We discussed how we could format the commands in a user-friendly way and how best to display them in the extension interface. These initial discussions were crucial to ensure that we had a clear vision before diving into the development process.

Once we were aligned, we assigned tasks based on each group member’s strengths. I found this approach effective, as it allowed us to focus on areas where we could each contribute most efficiently. Communication was key throughout the week; we kept in touch regularly via group chat to share updates, address challenges, and ensure everyone was on the same page. This constant communication made the process much smoother and helped us remain coordinated.

Although we had made progress, we did face some challenges. Since this was the first time any of us had worked on a project of this nature, we encountered obstacles that required research and experimentation. Learning how to work with browser extensions and figuring out the best ways to implement the commands was a steep learning curve, but it was incredibly rewarding.

## Reflection
Reflecting on my role in this project, I would say my primary contribution has been in the coding aspect of the extension. While my teammates worked on various open-source components and research, I focused on writing the code that powers the extension itself. I thoroughly enjoyed this part of the project and felt a sense of accomplishment as the functionality started to come together. This experience also highlighted the benefits of collaborative work. I’ve found that I enjoy working in a group setting, which was somewhat of a revelation for me since I haven't participated in many group projects in recent memory. It’s been a great learning experience, and I look forward to continuing this collaboration with my team as we refine and expand our project.
