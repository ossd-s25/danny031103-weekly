## Idea
The idea we came up with was a browser extension that could be clicked on when searching through github repositories 
## Group Members

## Progress

INSTRUCTIONS:
Make your blog post. Comment on the work with your team and progress you have made towards your first browser extension (what are some problems the group is facing, what good things happened, how do you fit into the collaboration, what are your biggest contributions, were there any surprising things you discovered about yourself in the process of the group work)
