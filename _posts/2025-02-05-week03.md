title: Week 3 - Browser Extension Open Source Project
---

## Idea
For this week's prject, the idea we came up with was a browser extension that can be used to quickly reference common and useful git commands. This extension can drastically eliminate the time needed for beginner developers to make changes to repositories and can also help eliminate confusion regarding commands.

## Group Members
Daniel Brito, Fox Zhang, Jahleel Townsend

## Progress
This week we ideated to better understand what problem we were trying to solve. We wrote down the commands we typically used and researched common ones that other developers may want access to through our browser extension. We talked about formatting, and how to best carry out the display feature. 

After this, we began working--assigning tasks to each group member based on our strengths and weaknesses. We kept in touch through a group chat to better tackle the issues that came up. I believe this was one of the good things that happened since we all remained on the same page in regards to the project.

Some of the problems we faced stemmed from the fact that this was the first time any of us had created a project like this one. This came with its own set of unique challenges that took research to tackle. 

Although this has been a team effort, I would say that my biggest contribution has come through the implementation of the code that makes the extension work. My teammates took care of a lot of the open source parts of the project which allowed me to focus my time on the actual coding of the project, which I enjoyed. I discovered that I enjoy working in a group setting, which was new since I haven't had many classes in recent memory. I look forward to continued collaboration with my group.
