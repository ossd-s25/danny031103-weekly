## Projects So Far
The projects seen so far, through discussions in class and personal research into potential options, has shown me that not all projects are as beginner friendly as I had anticipated. Many projects, although exciting, have inactive members and have not seen true involvement for many years.

In particular, CoralNet--a project that I had mentioned in a previous blog post has only one active member currently contributing to the project. His contributions at the moment seemed to also be aimed at fixing existing bugs, not adding new features. This was mentioned in class as a stage that many open source projects go through, however I believe that it is not a great stage to get involved in as a beginner as it lacks much of the excitement that a new, active project would have. Other projects discussed in class did not share this disadvantage, which makes them worthy candidates to look into. They are, however, not without faults as some were not beginner friendly for other reasons.

## Looking Forward
Now that I have a bit more of an understanding of open source projects, I think I am most excited about choosing one that I am genuinely interested in and contributing to it in a way that I am proud of. I really like the idea of becoming a core contributor on a project that is very useful or solves some real world issue. The sense of community seen in some open source projects is something I am truly interested in experiencing. 

## Challenges
I think that the biggest challenge to getting involved in open source projects is just the initial commitment. It takes a long time and quite a bit of effort to start looking into a project and contributing since you must first understand the project and guidelines well. Once this is done, I think the rest will come with practice over time. I plan to overcome this by just finding a project that I'm interested in and taking the leap to learn how to contribute. I'm sure I will fail and new challenges will come up but with perserverance and interaction with the community I believe I can overcome them.
