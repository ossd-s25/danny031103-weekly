title: Week 5 - Project Evaluations
---

## Introduction
As I dive deeper into the world of open source, I’ve started evaluating various projects through both classroom discussions and personal research. This process has given me a clearer understanding of what to expect from open source contributions, particularly as a beginner.

## Projects So Far

The projects I’ve explored so far, through class discussions and my own research, have shown me that not all projects are as beginner-friendly as I had anticipated. Many of these projects, while exciting, have inactive members and haven’t seen true involvement in years.

In particular, CoralNet—a project I mentioned in a previous blog post—currently has only one active member contributing to the project. His efforts seem focused on fixing existing bugs rather than adding new features. While this stage of development is common in open source projects, as discussed in class, it’s not an ideal stage for beginners to get involved. It lacks the excitement that comes with a new, active project. That said, other projects discussed in class didn’t share this disadvantage, making them promising candidates to explore. However, they are not without faults, as some are not beginner-friendly for different reasons.


## Looking Forward
Now that I have a better understanding of open source projects, I am most excited about choosing one that I am genuinely passionate about. I want to contribute to a project in a way that I can be proud of and ultimately become a core contributor to something useful or that solves a real-world issue. The sense of community seen in some open source projects is something I’m eager to experience firsthand.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge I see in getting involved with open source projects is the initial commitment. It takes time and effort to understand a project and its guidelines before contributing. Once that foundation is set, I believe the rest will come with practice. My plan is to find a project that excites me and take the leap to learn how to contribute. I expect to face failures and new challenges, but with perseverance and active participation in the community, I’m confident I can overcome them.
