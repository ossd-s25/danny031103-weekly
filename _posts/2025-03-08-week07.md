title: Week 6 - Choosing a Project
---

## Introduction
This semester has been all about diving into open source software development, and although we haven’t started contributing code yet, it's been an exciting journey of exploration. My two teammates and I have spent this week getting to know the landscape of open source projects, leading to our decision to choose Oppia as our project.

## Project Information
After several brainstorming sessions and a deep dive into different open source projects, our group unanimously agreed that Oppia is the right fit for us. Oppia’s focus on interactive learning really caught our attention, and we’re excited about the opportunity to contribute to a tool that has a meaningful impact in education. For now, we’re in the process of understanding its architecture, exploring the documentation, and figuring out where we can make our first contributions.

## Obstacles
At this early stage, our main challenges are getting a solid grasp on Oppia’s current setup and aligning our vision as a team. The sheer amount of technical details in the documentation can be a bit overwhelming, and we’re still learning the best ways to navigate its codebase. Additionally, as a group of three, we’re working on establishing effective communication and setting clear roles, which is proving essential for our future success.

## Moving Forward
Looking ahead, we plan to immerse ourselves further in the Oppia community. Our immediate goal is to thoroughly explore the documentation, identify areas where we can contribute, and start small so that we build confidence and familiarity with the codebase. Regular team meetings and discussions will help us define clear roles and set achievable milestones. I’m really looking forward to turning our insights into tangible contributions and sharing our progress in the weeks to come.
