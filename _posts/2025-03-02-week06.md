title: Week 6 - Small Contributions
---

## Introduction
This semester has focused on understanding Open Source Software Development, learning how to get started, and practicing the process of selecting and contributing to a project. As I’ve explored different ways to get involved, I’ve realized that even small contributions can have a meaningful impact on open-source communities.

## Wikipedia Contributions
So far, most of my contributions have been Wikipedia edits. Since Wikipedia is an open-source platform for knowledge, I saw it as an accessible starting point for making meaningful contributions. I focused on topics I’m familiar with, such as the Emerald Crab page, where I added relevant but missing information based on my own experience as an owner. This helped me appreciate the value of even minor improvements in making information more complete and useful for others.  

To take my contributions further, I created an entirely new Wikipedia page for my favorite snowboard binding company, which previously had no dedicated entry. I was surprised to find that such a well-known company lacked a Wikipedia presence, so I took the initiative to research its history and compile the details into a structured page. Now, others can learn more about the company, its origins, and its impact on the industry.

## Future Contributions
Having contributed extensively to Wikipedia, I now want to shift toward more technical, code-based projects. While editing Wikipedia strengthened my ability to make meaningful edits and validate sources, I’m eager to contribute to open-source software in a more hands-on way.  

One area I’m particularly interested in is our class browser extension project. I’ve reached out to teams working on similar extensions to collaborate on implementing a new feature. So far, I haven’t received any responses, but I’m hoping to connect with a team soon. Even if this particular effort doesn’t work out, I plan to continue looking for small but impactful ways to contribute to other open-source codebases.

## Open Source for Good
In class, we’ve also explored Open Source projects aimed at benefiting humanity. This is an inspiring use case for open-source software, as it aligns with the idea that free and accessible technology can be a force for good. Learning about projects that provide life-saving information, support underfunded communities, or contribute to scientific advancements has been eye-opening.  

I would love to get involved in one of these initiatives, especially in a way that allows me to combine my technical skills with my personal interests. Contributing to projects that support environmental conservation or marine life protection, for example, would be especially meaningful to me. Helping people—or the planet—through software is something I value, and I feel it’s often overlooked in software development compared to other career paths. Open source provides a unique opportunity to build tools that benefit others without the barrier of commercialization, and I’m excited to explore how I can be part of that movement.
