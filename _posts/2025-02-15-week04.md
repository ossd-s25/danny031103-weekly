title: Week 4 - Browser Extension Open Source Project

## Git Exercises
The git exercises we did in class helped reinforce the previous lessons I have had on git and Github. It is extremely important to understand these tools in order to work on a team as a software developer.

## Presentations
This week's presentations were very fun and interesting to watch. I really enjoyed the creativity of other teams and how everyone interpreted the assignment in different ways. Some of my personal favorite extensions were the notepad and the unlimited scrolling of a webpage. These two used APIs that I had never heard of and introduced me to concepts I may want to implement. I also thought it was interesting to see the way that other teams collaborated, split the work, and presented their projects.

## Takeaways
The biggest takeaway was learning from other teams' work processes. I njoyed hearing about how teams helped each other out when struggling, delegated tasks to those that were most familiar in certain subjects, and iterated through their ideas. My own team could have improved, especially in our presentation--which we rushed since we mistakingly thought we were low on time. More practice of pacing and flow of presentations would benefit us in the future.
